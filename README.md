## Data
The data I propose to visualize for my project is COVID Patient Cases data in May2020. 
The original data was taken from Kaggle: Corona virus cases. It has covid patient count, death counts reported all over the world. For the visualization purpose this data is filtered only for month of May.
This data is available on my gist [World corona virus cases May2020](https://gist.github.com/manasishrotri/4e43a48d4a8c89f011dbf18b7de28190)

With the box plot we can see which contry had more variation in data. Brazil has distribution of data going from 0 till 30000 which means number of cases significantly increases for Brazil while for India and Peru it was controlled.
